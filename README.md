# LogiFindFPGATest
This is a Quartus Prime FPGA project testing the functionality of the LogiFind Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE6E22C8N Development Board. This product can also be found on eBay where I bought it from. I hope to provide base code that will help others in their learning with this development board.

I use a few SystemVerilog features in this project such as enums, packages, and floating-point rounding. Thus, SystemVerilog must be enabled to run this project. If you are receiving errors about the line:
`import UART_CONSTANTS::*;`

Then, you likely do not have SystemVerilog enabled for the compiler.
